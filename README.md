You can change our program as you like and use it anywhere, but please refer to its original source and cite our paper.

# Introduction
Numerous single image super-resolution (SISR) algorithms have been proposed to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) image from its low-resolution (LR) observation. However, the majority of these algorithms are only validated on synthetic data. It remains unclear how these algorithms would perform on real-world images. In addition, it is also unclear whether the existing image quality metrics can be used for quality evaluation of real-world SISR. To bridge this gap, we make the following attempts. First, we construct a new real-world SISR quality evaluation benchmark dataset, i.e., RealSRQ. Second, we propose a new objective metric, i.e., KLTSRQA, based on the Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) to evaluate the quality of real-world SISR images accurately. As shown in our paper, KLTSRQA is highly consistent with human perception.

# RealSRQUE
This dataset concludes 60 high resolution (HR) images, 180 low resolution (LR) images and 1620 super-resolved (SR) images generated by applying 10 representative SISR algorithms on LR images at multiple scaling factors, i.e., LR2, LR3, LR4. Most importantly, the HR-LR image pairs in our dataset are captured in the world by adjusting focal length of digital single lens reflex (DSLR) camera. However, the LR images in most of the existing work are synthesized from the pristine HR image using simple degradation model. The real-world LR images will introduce more complex distortions which provide a challenge to the existing SISR algorithms. We also conduct a large scale subjective user study and perform a comprehensive analysis to quantify the performance of the SISR algorithms that we selected.

# KLTSRQA
In our paper, we demonstrate that the existing objective metrics can not precisely evaluated the SISR results. To solve this problem, we propose a new objective metric, i.e., KLTSRQA, based on the Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) to evaluate the quality of real-world SISR images accurately. The extensive experiments in our paper demonstrate that KLTSRQA is highly consistent with human perception.
