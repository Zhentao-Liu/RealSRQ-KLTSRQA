# Abstract
Numerous single image super-resolution (SISR) algorithms have been proposed to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) image from its low-resolution (LR) observation. However, the majority of these algorithms are only validated on synthetic data. So far, the lack of comprehensive human subjective study on large-scale real-world SISR datasets and accurate objective SISR quality assessment metrics makes it unreliable to truly understand the performance of different SISR algorithms on real-world data. We make the following attemps tackle these two issues. Firstly, we construct a real-world SISR quality dataset (i.e., *RealSRQ*) and conduct human subjective studies to compare the performance of the representative SISR algorithms. Secondly, we propose a objective metric, i.e., *KLTSRQA*, based on the Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) to evaluate the quality of real-world SISR images in a no-reference (NR) manner. Experiments on our constructed *RealSRQ* and the latest synthetic SISR quality dataset (i.e., *QADS* [1]) have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed *KLTSRQA* metric, achieving higher consistency with human subjective scores than relevant existing NR image quality assessment (NR-IQA) metrics.
