Author  : Zhentao Liu et al.
Version : 1.1

This folder includes a real-world SISR image quality evaluation dataset (RealSRQE) that we constructed and 
implemantation of KLT Based Blind Image Quality Assessment (KLTSRQA) that we proposed. The dataset and 
algorithm are described in:

You can change this program as you like and use it anywhere, but please refer to its original source (cite our paper)

Document Description and Usage

Folder :
1. pristine
This folder includes all the HR images in RealSRQE. We use these HR images for KLT kernel training.

2. RealSRQE
This folder includes the dataset that we constructed. It includes HR-LR image pairs and corresponding SISR results.

M file ï¼š
1. color_change.m
This is used for color space conversion from RGB to a perceptual quality relevant opponent color space.

2. estimateaggdparam.m
This is used for KLT coefficients AGGD parameter estimation.

3. modcrop.m
This is used to crop image border.

4. MSCN_compute.m
This is used to compute MSCN coefficients of input image.

5. patch_extract.m
This is used for image patch extraction.

6. KLT_kernel_training.m
This is used for KLT kernel training with specified kernel size.

7. KLT_feature.m
This is used for feature extraction.

8. Kernel_training_demo.m
This is a demo for kernel training. 

9. feature_extract_demo.m
This is a demo for feature extraction.

MAT file :
1. KLT_kernel_64.mat
This is our pretrained KLT kernel with size 64*64 using the images in pristine folder.

2. subj_BT_score.mat
This is the BT score of each SISR result that derived from subjective user study.

This code has been tested on Windows in MATLAB
